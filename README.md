======

This project consists of a simple script that helps in the creation of Typescript
definition files for existing Javascript libraries. No documentation has been written
for this yet, but it'll be easy enough to get started by having a look at `example.js`,
which uses the [Chroma.js](http://driven-by-data.net/about/chromajs) library as an
example (which happens to be the first library I needed to create a definition file for).

Have fun!
